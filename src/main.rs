/*
We have four commands for using Cargo during our development workflow with Rust.

- Cargo new: to create a new project in Rust.
- Cargo build: to compile our project. Usually, a target folder is created and the compiled code is placed inside it.
- Cargo run: to run the project. It mainly executes a Cargo Build first and then executes the compiled code, all in a single command.
- Cargo Check: to verify if the project can be compiled without errors.
